# SvelteKit Template

Everything you need to build a Svelte project to deploy on Cloudflare Pages:

- Drizzle - ORM
- Cloudflare D1 - SQLite Based Database
- Tailwind CSS
- DaisyUI - Tailwind Based UI Library
- Paraglide - i18n

## Developing

Once you've cloned the repository and installed dependencies with `pnpm install`, start a development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
pnpm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `pnpm run preview`.

## Disclaimer

This is just how I like to build my apps, everything here is my own personal preference.
